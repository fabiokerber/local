## Benefits<br>
Self healing is better than depending on humans for several reasons:<br>
<br>
*. "Automated solutions are less likely to miss issues by mistake, or to make errors when resolving them."*<br>
*. "Self-healing technology is better positioned to fix problems faster than humans because it can react instantly based on rules or machine learning. It doesn’t have to stop and think about the issue before taking action."*<br>
*. "A self-healing environment can scale without limit. This is a key advantage over manually managed environments, whose scalability is limited in some respects by the availability of human admins."*<br>
